# Litematica Quick Start Guide

## Introduction
`.litematic` files are a very common way to share technical builds with others. These are created using the **Litematica** mod, which also provides you with the ability to rebuild those builds in your own survival worlds, by rendering a blueprint over the world which you can use to guide the building process, removing the need for a video tutorial.

The aim of this guide is to guide you through the process of:
1. **Install Litematica and other required mods, as well as the Fabric mod loader.**
2. **Paste schematics into a creative copy to test if it works in your environment.**
3. **Rebuild from that schematic in your survival world.**

**Note**: this is **not a guide to using Litematica for creating your own `.litematic` files.** This guide is aimed at more casual players, whose only interest is in using the mod for rebuilding schematics in their own worlds.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Is Litematica on Forge?**\
For most game versions, no. I would recommend against using unofficial Forge ports.

**Do you need to have Litematica installed on the server?**\
Nope! Litematica is a fully client-side mod, so you don't need to have anything extra installed on your server!
