# Navigating the `.minecraft` folder

## Getting to your `.minecraft` folder

### Windows
1. Press Win+R, to open the `Run` popup.
2. Type in `%appdata%`, and press `Enter`.
3. In the folder that opens, you should find your `.minecraft` folder.

_I don't know how the process on other platforms, so if someone else has the information on that, please throw it at me!_

## The schematics folder
By default, Litematica will read `*.litematic` files from `.minecraft/schematics`. You should move any `*.litematic` files you download into this folder so that you can use them with Litematica!

This folder will be created by Litematica. If it doesn't exist yet, you can create it yourself.
